## Specifications
```
Describe: checkNumber()

Test: It should return an array of values to the length of user input.
Expect: (robogersInput(5).toEqual([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));

Test: On each loop it will check for  1, 2, or 3 and converts them to new string.
Expect: checkNumber[1].toString(Boop)  and  checkNumber[2].toString(Beep) 
and checkNumber[3].toString("Wont you be my neighbor")

Test: check for 13, 21, and 31 exceptions and convert those to  chosen strings.
Expect checkNumber[13].toString(Boop)  and  checkNumber[21].toString(Beep) 
and checkNumber[31].toString("Wont you be my neighbor")

Test: Once those numbers have been converted on loop to then push the results to the output field
Expect checkNumber[0,beep, boop, Wont you be my neighbor, 5.... so on
